# gohan

Aegix Linux uses GOHAN to store and configure dot files deployed by [BARBS](https://aegixlinux.org/barbs.sh).

There are a collection of neat scripts located in `~/.local/bin` you can check out.

There are configurations for vim, zsh, lf, sxiv, mpv, mpd/ncmpcpp, xdg default programs, inputrc, and others.

Check out shell aliases, directory and file bookmarks in the `~/.config/shell/` directory.

Compatibility with the Aegix builds of suckless software programs dwm, dwmblocks, dmenu, st is baked in.

Gohan means "cooked rice" in Japanese, and it is a synonym for food in general. The literal translation for the Japanese words for breakfast and dinner is "the morning rice" and "the evening rice."
The "go" in gohan is an honorific form added to "han" which adds politeness to the word.
This repository is like the cooked rice of Aegix.

~ Sosan desu ga, dohzo o-meshi agari kudasai. ~

This phrase reflects a humble invitation for you to use this project.

``` Text
"Sosan desu ga" = "This is modest" or "It's not much".
It's a common phrase in Japanese used when offering something to someone as a way to show humility.

"Dohzo" = "Please"

"O-meshi agari kudasai" is a polite form of a phrase used to invite someone to eat.
It can be translated as "Please enjoy your meal" or "Please help yourself".

So, the entire sentence "Sosan desu ga, dohzo o-meshi agari kudasai." can be translated to
"It's not much, but please, help yourself to the meal."
This is something a host might say to a guest when serving a meal in Japan.
The host is expressing humility and politeness, both of which are very important in Japanese culture.

It's not much, but pls try ðŸ™‡
