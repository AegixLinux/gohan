# gohan

Dot files are usually based on configuration, and they start with a `.`.
Aegix uses this repo `gohan` to store and configure dot files deployed by [BARBS](https://aegixlinux.org/barbs.sh).

There are a collection of neat scripts located in `~/.local/bin` you can check out.

There are configurations for vim, zsh, lf, sxiv, mpv, mpd/ncmpcpp, xdg default programs, inputrc, and others.

Check out shell aliases, directory and file bookmarks in the `~/.config/shell/` directory.

Compatibility with the Aegix builds of suckless software programs dwm, dwmblocks, dmenu, st is baked in.

Gohan means "cooked rice" in Japanese, and it is a synonym for food in general. The literal translation for the Japanese words for breakfast and dinner is "the morning rice" and "the evening rice."
The "go" in gohan is an honorific form added to "han" which adds politeness to the word.
This repository is like the cooked rice of Aegix.

It's not much, but pls try ðŸ™‡
